  <h1> Take a moment </h1>
  <p> Chances are you are thinking about short form "game based" improv. Where the performers are given a set of restrictions to apply to their scene. Such as: Nobody is allowed to ask a question, or <bold> ONLY </bold> allowed to ask questions. But give yourself a moment to sit and reflect. What types of restrictions have we put on ourselves, or have been imposed on us from outside. </p>

  <p> Some of my restrictions:
    <ul> <li> No harming others </li> <li> Try to eat a salad </li> <li> Don't drive 90 mph down city streets</li></ul>
  </p>
  <h1> Restrictive sources </h1>
  <p> Some restrictions are chosen, while others are imposed upon us. Restrictions can also be a matter of custom, with minimal enforcement. While others are highly regulated with severe penalties for breaching them </p>

    <tr>
      <th> Self </th>
      <th> Custom </th>
      <th> Regulated </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Vegan </td>
      <td> No white after labor day </td>
      <td> Speed limit </td>
    </tr>
  <p> These restrictions are often helpful in trying to navigate our relationships with others. Although sometimes they cause more harm than the harm they are attempting to prevent. In an improv scene of any form the primary regulation is to accept, then build. Even though a scene may be a argument between two characters, the scene itself is built upon accepting the other characters position as being valid. this is usually shortened to "Yes, and..." </p>
  <h2> Real life </h2>
  <p> In everyday life this is an excellent way to build rapport with those around you. Friends are simply people who validate each other.</p>
