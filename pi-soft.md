  <h1> Ya-but... Nah-but... Nah-and.. </h1>
  <p> All of these responses CAN help move a scene, or a personal interaction. But it takes a lot more effort. </p>
  <h2> Imagine...</h2>
  <p> Sally: Do you want to go to the park? <b>
    George: I don't want to go. <b>
    Sally: You have to go with me <b>

    This is a scenario which will likely lead to an argument, and take forever to resolve. Neither person is validating the other, or adding to the interaction. <b>

    Sally: We should go to the park <b>
    George: That sounds fun, although I don't really want to go. <b>
    Sally: I know you're not a big fan of parks, but I want to spend time with you.<b>

    Again we have the same basic situation, however in this case the two people are disagreeing, but amicably. They are both recognizing, and validating the other persons point of view, and adding additional information.
